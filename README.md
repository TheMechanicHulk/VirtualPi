# VirtualPi: Raspberry Pi 4 Hardware Simulation

## Overview
VirtualPi is a software-based simulation environment that emulates Raspberry Pi 4 hardware using the QEMU hypervisor. This project allows for comprehensive unit testing of software applications intended for the Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu Server OS. By providing a controlled simulation environment, developers can ensure functionality and compatibility before deploying applications on physical hardware.

## Features
- **Raspberry Pi 4 Emulation**: Simulates Raspberry Pi 4 hardware to enable software testing without needing physical devices.
- **Ubuntu Server OS**: Runs a complete Ubuntu Server operating system in the simulated environment, providing a realistic testing platform.
- **Unit Testing**: Facilitates comprehensive unit testing for software applications, ensuring compatibility with Raspberry Pi 4 hardware.
- **Bash Scripting**: Utilizes a bash script for automated setup and management of the QEMU environment.

## Workflow
1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Developed a QEMU-based simulation environment for Raspberry Pi 4, including configuration for Ubuntu Server OS.
  
2. **Testing Phase**:
    - Conducted unit testing of various software applications, verifying their performance and compatibility in the simulated environment.

3. **Bash Script Automation**:
    - Created a bash script to automate the launch and configuration of the QEMU simulation, streamlining the testing process.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheMechanicHulk/VirtualPi.git
    cd VirtualPi
    ```

2. **Install QEMU**:
    - Ensure that QEMU is installed on your system:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install qemu-system-arm qemu-efi
    ```

3. **Run the Simulation**:
    - Execute the bash script to start the Raspberry Pi 4 simulation:
    ```bash
    bash start_virtualpi.sh
    ```
